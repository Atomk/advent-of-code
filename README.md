# advent-of-code

My solutions for puzzles at https://adventofcode.com.

Currently I'm writing the solutions in Python, because it's the easiest for me to run and code in (for the most part), so I can dedicate more mental resources to the actual puzzles.

As of 2024 this is the first time I participate to che challenge.

I am also writing some notes in the solution files to document some of my thought, I hope future me finds those interesting!
