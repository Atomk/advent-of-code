The description for this part is short, I always appreciate it because
it may mean it's not too complex. But several times this correlation
turned out to be just in my head. Let's see if I can get two stars
on this last puzzle.
---
Noooooooo I have to get all stars on all the other puzzles first!
A real bummer, but probably a good excuse to revisit some of what I did not solve.
Here the descriptions says I need other 11 stars to continue to the last part
of AoC, of course I'm not gonna take them all today, but during this
challenge I learned a few things and I think with that added knowledge
I may have an easier time solving some things that I was stumped on.
I also have a bunch of uncommitted notes and tests that also may be helpful.
Right now I'm missing the second star for these days:
6, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 20, 24, 25 (today)
And I just realized I did not look at day 21 yet, so that is missing two stars.
Going to work on that first and then revisit the puzzls listed above in order,
until motivation runs out. About this, I have a hard time being consistent
so I'm very positively surprised that I could reach this point.
I had plenty of free time thi month so this helped a lot, but given my
track record this does not detract at all from the achievement.
